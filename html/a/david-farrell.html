   Reddit is link-sharing and discussing site running on some open source Python code. It has so called 'subredits' that are categories for sharing links related to a specific topic. Posting an article on Reddit can get hundreds or thousands of additional visitors to an article, and via their aggregation it can expose the Perl-related activity to other communities as well.

   By default vim, as most of the other editors, recognize the type of a file based on their extension. Because the in many cases the file extension of Perl 5 and Perl 6 files are the same, vim keeps trying to use the Perl 5 syntax highlighter on Perl 6 files, and fails. David has a couple of suggestions, including looking at the content of the file, to recognize that it is a Perl 6 file. He also provides the vim script for this.
