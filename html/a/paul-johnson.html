   <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/paul_johnson/2014/10/final-tpf-develcover-grant-report.html">Final TPF Devel::Cover grant report</a><br>
   Paul Johnson reports on his awesome Devel::Cover work (tl;dr? just go to <a href="http://cpancover.com/">cpancover.com</a> and stare at the covered beauty of it all).

   <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/paul_johnson/2016/03/upping-minimum-version-for-develcover.html">Upping minimum version for Devel::Cover</a><br>
   Paul has difficulty testing Devel::Cover on older versions of Perl and thus he is raising the minimum required version of his module. He just wonders if anyone finds that problematic. I think there is a general issue of how much open source developers want to spend their time supporting code free of charge. What do you think?

   <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/paul_johnson/2016/04/happy-15th-birthday-develcover.html">Happy 15th Birthday, Devel::Cover!</a><br>
   Paul first released <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Devel::Cover">Devel::Cover</a> on 9th April 2001, the day after Perl 5.6.1 was released. Paul has been chief maintainer from then 'til now, but he also points out that 86 other people have contributed to it over the last 15 years.

   As Paul puts it: 'A large part of the value of the QA hackathon is in the discussions that take place when people can sit together and thrash something out, or bounce ideas off each other.'
