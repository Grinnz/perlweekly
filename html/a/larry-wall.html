   It is really unclear what does this event cover, but it seems Larry Wall is going to give a talk at FOSDEM in Brussels in February 2015, where he will talk about Perl 6 being production ready in the same year. Looks interesting and FOSDEM is probably the biggest Open Source event in the world with over 5,000 visitors.

   This is pretty much the same talk Larry gave at YAPC::Asia, but if you haven't watch that one yet, then watch this one. Duration: 55 minutes.
