   <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/makoto_nozaki/2015/07/grant-idea---dbixclass-re-documentation.html">Grant idea - DBIx::Class re-documentation</a><br>
   Ribasushi put forward an idea for a grant project: taking the lead on writing improved documentation for <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/DBIx::Class">DBIx::Class</a>. He points out that this is not a minor undertaking.

   Ribasushi gave a lightning talk at YAPC:NA this year, and tweeted about the topic again this week. His message was: if there's something you don't like about a module, it's easy to let the author know by sending email to the RT mail alias. I thought it would be neat to have a bug email demultiplexor for CPAN, where we could email dist-name@bug.perl.org and it would check whether the dist has a specified bug tracker, using that if so, or RT otherwise. But Ribasushi pointed out that GitHub's T's &amp; C's don't allow this kind of automatic bug submission.

   <a href="https://www.tilt.com/tilts/year-of-ribasushi-help-him-focus-on-cpan-for-2016/description">Year of ribasushi</a><br>
   Peter "ribasushi" Rabbitson, known (amongst other things) as the maintainer of DBIx::Class, has started a Tilt campaign so he could work a full year on CPAN projects.

   Ribasushi's <a href="https://www.tilt.com/tilts/year-of-ribasushi-help-him-focus-on-cpan-for-2016/comments/CMTE1601B878F7343E7B05BB89BB81D4650">tilt campaign</a> was unsuccessful. As a result he's going to step away from his CPAN distributions, but before he does there will be one last <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/DBIx::Class">DBIx::Class</a> release.
