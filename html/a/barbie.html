   <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/barbie/2015/03/a-year-of-cpan-uploads.html">A Year of CPAN Uploads</a><br>
   There are some really crazy people out there. For example Barbie, who has been uploading modules to CPAN every day for more than a year now. That's real persistence.

   <a href="http://blog.cpantesters.org/diary/197">Uncommon OS Platforms Wanted for Testing</a><br>
   The CPAN Testers would like to see more testing being done on the less common platforms. If you happen to have access to operating systems that are not on the top of the <a href="http://stats.cpantesters.org/osmatrix-month.html">OS/Perl matrix</a>.

   <a href="http://blog.cpantesters.org/diary/199">CPAN Testers Site Update & Successor Wanted</a><br>
   CPAN Testers hasn't been very stable for the last 2 weeks; Barbie has posted an updated, but is also looking for one or more people who are interested in taking on CPAN Testers. Barbie's been looking after it for 10 years and says "it is definitely time for some fresh eyes".

   <a href="http://blog.cpantesters.org/diary/199">CPAN Testers Site Update & Successor Wanted</a><br>
   Barbie wishes to go no more a testing so late into the night, and is calling for heroic figures to take the testing torch from him. And as this PerlWeekly goes under press, a mysterious knight already seems to have stepped forward.

   <a href="http://blog.cpantesters.org/diary/200">CPAN Testers Is Back</a><br>
   CPAN Testers is one of those things that you only truly appreciate the value of when it goes away for a time. Like many CPAN authors, I'm very glad it's back!
