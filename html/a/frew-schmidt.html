   <a href="https://blog.afoolishmanifesto.com/posts/docker-first-impressions/">Docker: first impressions</a><br>
   Frew shares his experiences and thoughts using Docker for deployment, having used it for testing for nearly a year. I've no experience with Docker, ******************************[1]: you'll just have to decide for yourself.

   <a href="https://blog.afoolishmanifesto.com/posts/configuration-station/">Configuration Station</a><br>
   Frew shows how his thoughts on handling configuration has evolved via various technologies, to his latest approach.

   <a href="https://blog.afoolishmanifesto.com/posts/configuration-station">Configuration Station</a><br>
   fREW plays with a new Proof::ConfigLoader, which aims at being light on the syntax overhead while allowing overriding via environment variables.

   <a href="https://blog.afoolishmanifesto.com/posts/fear-and-loathing-in-sql-92/">Fear and Loathing in SQL-92</a><br>
   A war story used to illustrate a point, with some good tips and thoughts thrown in. For example, do you use, or are you aware of the <a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/functions/fc.html">fc</a> function (introduced in 5.16)? A good rule of thumb: "you should not emulate, imitate, or otherwise do the job of the database".

   <a href="https://blog.afoolishmanifesto.com/posts/cpan-patch-workflow/">CPAN Patch workflow</a><br>
   Patching modules is usually quick and easy. It's the mundane steps of repository cloning, git juggling and Pull Request crafting that usually take longer. fREW uses a mix of git-cpan, git-hub and fugitive.vim to smooth out that overhead.

   <a href="https://blog.afoolishmanifesto.com/posts/perl-and-kickstarter/">Perl ‚ù§ Kickstarter</a><br>
   Frew wrote a wee script using <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/WWW::Kickstarter">WWW::Kickstarter</a> to watch a kickstarter project and let him know when an early bird offer came available (because an existing backer had cancelled).

   <a href="https://blog.afoolishmanifesto.com/posts/cpan-patch-workflow-ii/">CPAN Patch Workflow II</a><br>
   Now that his patches have been accepted into Git-CPAN-Patch, fREW shows how 'git cpan send-email' can be used to send  PRs via RT.

   <a href="https://blog.afoolishmanifesto.com/posts/pid-namespaces-in-linux/">PID Namespaces in Linux</a><br>
   How to manage all your child processes, when your children kick off processes, and they in turn might kick some off. Frew presents two of the ways you can ensure that all of your descendent processes get cleaned up, and Tim Bunce pointed out another one in the comments.

   <a href="https://blog.afoolishmanifesto.com/posts/dbi-logging-and-profiling/">DBI Logging and Profiling</a><br>
   Using a database interface without knowing how to profile it is like knowing how to eat, but without being acquainted to the concept of napkin -- you can only go so far before it becomes socially awkward.

   <a href="https://blog.afoolishmanifesto.com/posts/faster-dbi-profiling/">Faster DBI Profiling</a><br>
   If you're profiling your DBI queries, perhaps after reading <a href="https://blog.afoolishmanifesto.com/posts/dbi-logging-and-profiling/">Frew's previous post</a>, then you should read this short post.
