   <a href="http://blog.afoolishmanifesto.com/archives/1525">Event Loops are better than while</a><br>
   fREW Schmidt gives an example how a simple while loop was replaced with an AnyEvent loop for better stability and eventually easier development.
</li>

<li>
   2011.08.24 in <a href="/archive/5.html">#5</a>
   <a href="http://blog.afoolishmanifesto.com/archives/1648">Refactoring Dispatch Tables into Objects</a><br>
   fREW Schmidt gives a nice and simple example on how to use simple dispatch tables. Then he goes on and shows how the same idea can be applied to methods of classes.
</li>

   2012.03.06 in <a href="/archive/33.html">#33</a>
   <a href="http://blog.afoolishmanifesto.com/archives/1687">The Rise and Fall of Event Loops (in one very small place of my code)</a><br>
   fREW Schmidt describes his adventure into using POE for event loops just to find out that in his use case he does not really need those event loops. It is nice to see the code snippets for both his original attempt and the solution he ended up using.
</li>

<li>
   2012.05.15 in <a href="/archive/43.html">#43</a>
   <a href="http://blog.afoolishmanifesto.com/archives/1692">Using search.cpan.org AND metacpan</a><br>
   fREW Schmidt created a greasemonkey/dotjs script and visit search.cpan.org . Run a search there. The results will link to MetaCPAN.
</li>

<li>
   2012.05.21 in <a href="/archive/44.html">#44</a>
   <a href="http://blog.afoolishmanifesto.com/archives/1696">Introducing Catalyst::Controller::Accessors</a><br>
   fREW Schmidt has a few relatively new modules he is planning to describe, the first one being Catalyst::Controller::Accessors.  First he shows the full version of his code using Catalyst chaining and then shows how using Catalyst::Controller::Accessors can eliminate some of code repetition, turning them into declarations.

   <a href="http://blog.afoolishmanifesto.com/archives/1717">Introducing DBIx::Class::Helper::Schema::LintContents</a><br>
   How do you add primary, unique, and foreign key constraints to an existing database if you don't have direct access to it? As in the case of an application installed at clients. fREW Schmidt has the answer.
</li>

<li>
   2012.06.06 in <a href="/archive/46.html">#46</a>
   <a href="http://blog.afoolishmanifesto.com/archives/1727">DBIx::Class::DeploymentHandler + Backups</a><br>
   fREW Schmidt is explaining how they used to do application deployment and database upgrade which promped him to the creation of the module. Then he starts showing use cases of the modules. The first one is backing up the data.
</li>

<li>
   2012.09.03 in <a href="/archive/59.html">#59</a>
   <a href="http://blog.afoolishmanifesto.com/archives/1695">Hash your passwords!</a><br>
   fREW Schmidt is back with a new security related article with lots of code examples. If you are running any application in which you need to store passwords, fREW gives you an example how to do it in a way that is a lot more secure than some of the (recently cracked) major web-sites did.

   <a href="http://blog.afoolishmanifesto.com/archives/1758">Announcing DBIx::Class::MaterializedPath</a><br>
   When you are not using PostgreSQL, and you still would like to store tree-like data in a table, fREW Schmidt has the solution. Currently, it only works on perl 5.16 as it uses some of the new features there. I am sure it can be worked around, but this might help people understand how upgrades save time and money.

   2013.01.05 in <a href="/archive/76.html">#76</a>
   <a href="http://blog.afoolishmanifesto.com/archives/1807">Abstraction Levels</a><br>
   How do you decide on the abstraction level when you design your API? fREW Schmidt asked. Do you let people override your methods or do you just create functions? When do you need to allow sub-classing and when is that an overkill?
</li>

<li>
   2013.07.27 in <a href="/archive/105.html">#105</a>
   <a href="http://blog.afoolishmanifesto.com/archives/1873">Event Loops: Useful After All</a><br>
   Event-based programming is prone to induce headaches. But in some cases, if used in the right manner it can provide tremendously simple solutions to tricky problems, as fREW Schmidt shows us.

   2014.07.17 in <a href="/archive/156.html">#156</a>
   <a href="https://blog.afoolishmanifesto.com/posts/a-gentle-tls-intro-for-perlers">A Gentle TLS Intro for Perlers</a><br>
   Security is hard. An absolute requirement in this bold new world, but, yeah, it's hard.  Fortunately, fREW Schmidt provides us here a nice, gentle introduction to TLS.
</li>

   2015.01.25 in <a href="/archive/183.html">#183</a>
   <a href="https://blog.afoolishmanifesto.com/posts/asyncronous-musings">Asynchronous Musings</a><br>
   Could have been called "Embrassing the Future(s)", as fREW leverages these constructs for asynchronous programming.
</li>

<li>
   2015.01.28 in <a href="/archive/184.html">#184</a>
   <a href="https://blog.afoolishmanifesto.com/posts/docker-first-impressions/">Docker: first impressions</a><br>
   Frew shares his experiences and thoughts using Docker for deployment, having used it for testing for nearly a year. I've no experience with Docker, ******************************[1]: you'll just have to decide for yourself.
</li>

<li>
   2015.02.19 in <a href="/archive/187.html">#187</a>
   <a href="https://blog.afoolishmanifesto.com/posts/configuration-station/">Configuration Station</a><br>
   Frew shows how his thoughts on handling configuration has evolved via various technologies, to his latest approach.
</li>

<li>
   2015.03.02 in <a href="/archive/188.html">#188</a>
   <a href="https://blog.afoolishmanifesto.com/posts/configuration-station">Configuration Station</a><br>
   fREW plays with a new Proof::ConfigLoader, which aims at being light on the syntax overhead while allowing overriding via environment variables.
</li>

   2015.03.04 in <a href="/archive/189.html">#189</a>
   <a href="https://blog.afoolishmanifesto.com/posts/fear-and-loathing-in-sql-92/">Fear and Loathing in SQL-92</a><br>
   A war story used to illustrate a point, with some good tips and thoughts thrown in. For example, do you use, or are you aware of the <a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/functions/fc.html">fc</a> function (introduced in 5.16)? A good rule of thumb: "you should not emulate, imitate, or otherwise do the job of the database".
</li>

   2015.03.27 in <a href="/archive/192.html">#192</a>
   <a href="https://blog.afoolishmanifesto.com/posts/faster-dbic-schemata/">Faster DBIC Schemata</a><br>
   Frew shares some tips on how to get DBIC schema to load faster.
</li>

<li>
   2015.07.30 in <a href="/archive/210.html">#210</a>
   <a href="https://blog.afoolishmanifesto.com/posts/cpan-patch-workflow/">CPAN Patch workflow</a><br>
   Patching modules is usually quick and easy. It's the mundane steps of repository cloning, git juggling and Pull Request crafting that usually take longer. fREW uses a mix of git-cpan, git-hub and fugitive.vim to smooth out that overhead.
</li>

<li>
   2015.08.03 in <a href="/archive/211.html">#211</a>
   <a href="https://blog.afoolishmanifesto.com/posts/perl-and-kickstarter/">Perl ‚ù§ Kickstarter</a><br>
   Frew wrote a wee script using <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/WWW::Kickstarter">WWW::Kickstarter</a> to watch a kickstarter project and let him know when an early bird offer came available (because an existing backer had cancelled).
</li>

<li>
   2015.08.11 in <a href="/archive/212.html">#212</a>
   <a href="https://blog.afoolishmanifesto.com/posts/cpan-patch-workflow-ii/">CPAN Patch Workflow II</a><br>
   Now that his patches have been accepted into Git-CPAN-Patch, fREW shows how 'git cpan send-email' can be used to send  PRs via RT.

   <a href="https://blog.afoolishmanifesto.com/posts/pid-namespaces-in-linux/">PID Namespaces in Linux</a><br>
   How to manage all your child processes, when your children kick off processes, and they in turn might kick some off. Frew presents two of the ways you can ensure that all of your descendent processes get cleaned up, and Tim Bunce pointed out another one in the comments.

   <a href="https://blog.afoolishmanifesto.com/posts/dbi-logging-and-profiling/">DBI Logging and Profiling</a><br>
   Using a database interface without knowing how to profile it is like knowing how to eat, but without being acquainted to the concept of napkin -- you can only go so far before it becomes socially awkward.
</li>

<li>
   2016.05.18 in <a href="/archive/252.html">#252</a>
   <a href="https://blog.afoolishmanifesto.com/posts/faster-dbi-profiling/">Faster DBI Profiling</a><br>
   If you're profiling your DBI queries, perhaps after reading <a href="https://blog.afoolishmanifesto.com/posts/dbi-logging-and-profiling/">Frew's previous post</a>, then you should read this short post.
