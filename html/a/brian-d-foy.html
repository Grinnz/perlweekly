   It's possible, with the help of a Perl module and a Firefox add-on, to have those two pieces of software talk to each other like best buddies. Web testing, browsing automation, javascript shenanigans, think of the possibilities...

   brian posted his thoughts on perl and recruitment, in response to <a href="http://perlhacks.com/2014/12/perl-recruitment-thoughts/">Dave's post last week</a>. Hard to distil down to a pithy one-liner, but here's one good soundbite: "Pay doesn't matter if you suck".

   <a href="http://www.learning-perl.com/2015/01/a-use-for-the-scalar-reverse-maybe/">A use for the scalar reverse (maybe)</a><br>
   The 'reverse' function of perl can easily trick people as it behaves differently in scalar and list context. In this article brian discusses some use cases when the scalar version of this function might be useful.

   As you upload newer and newer versions of your module to PAUSE and thus to CPAN, the old onese linger around taking up space and possibly confusing people. brian has this annual (or is that bi-annual?) ritual cleaning up his directory, removing the old versions. This time he goes further and makes sure modules he has on CPAN have their proper GitHub repository and other useful features.

   brian wonders whether README files are still needed these days, and if so, what should be in them? There are several conventions on CPAN, some dists just have a copy of the main module's doc, others have a summary, and yet others have installation instructions. Add your thoughts in the comments (if you can!).

   Using the postfix deferences that came with Perl 5.20? If you do, you might notice that Perl::MinimumVersion and Perl::MinimumVersion::Fast are a bit sloppy and think your code is respectively vintage 5.004 or 5.008. This  irks brian, so he rolled up his sleeves and dove into the C++-fueled heart of  darkness.

   A whole new meaning of defensive programming? The example is how to localize system-wide changes. If you put 'local $_ = undef;' in a block that will ensure '$_' gets its original value back when the block ends. Could you write 'local unlink $file;' and have the file delete for the duration of the function call? Could you do this with something less destructive like 'local chdir $other_dir;'?

   The 3-argument form of 'open' was added to Perl 5.6 to protect our code from attacks. This is quite well known. The question remained though: How does Perl open filenames when we use the diamond operator in a while loop? That was still vulnerable to the same kind of attacks. Using the new operator you can make your code safer.
