   David gives a straight-up, no-nonsense set of steps to get you a plenv-based Perl environment up and running in, oh, probably  less than 10 minutes.

   A while back David presented a way to migrate tickets from RT to github issues. Here he describes a more complete solution, which is <a href="https://github.com/dagolden/zzz-rt-to-github">available on github</a>.

   <a href="http://www.dagolden.com/index.php/2406/thoughts-on-getting-perl-6-for-christmas/">Thoughts on getting Perl 6 for Christmas</a><br>
   David lays out his current thinking on Perl 6. TL;DR: likes some bits, but thinks it seems large / complex and under-documented at the moment.

   <a href="http://www.dagolden.com/index.php/2414/this-distribution-name-can-only-be-used-by-users-with-permission/">Distributions much have a main module with matching name</a><br>
   David describes a change in PAUSE that can result in a slightly perplexing error message when you upload something to PAUSE. Basically, if you upload a distribution <code>Foo-Bar</code> to PAUSE, then it must contain a module <code>Foo::Bar</code>, otherwise it will not be added to the CPAN index. Existing dists not meeting this rule got an exception, but all new dists must satisfy this rule.

   In his contribution to the Perl 5.6 discussion, David's position is similar to Matt's, but he makes the observation that most 5.6 work seems to be related to smoke testing with 5.6, rather then people who are using Perl 5.6 in production.

   <a href="http://www.dagolden.com/index.php/2499/visualizing-perl-5-release-history-2015-edition/">Visualizing Perl 5 Release History â€“ 2015 edition</a><br>
   David periodically publishes a chart that shows the dates of the Perl 5 stable releases; this one shows from 5.4 to the most recent 5.22. The thing that really stands out is the steady march of yearly releases from 5.12 onwards.

   <a href="http://www.dagolden.com/index.php/2491/announcing-the-mongodb-perl-driver-v1-0-0-release-candidate/">Announcing the MongoDB Perl driver v1.0.0 Release Candidate</a><br>
   David announced the first release candidate for the Perl MongoDB driver, version 1.0.0. This is a "substantial rewrite" of the original Perl driver, so if you use MongoDB, they'd like you to kick the tyres, and perhaps a little bit more.

   If you are using MongoDB, this is likely a module lying deeply into your stack. And its next release is going to be a big, scary, bump-it-to-one-dot-oh release. Wisdom says you might just want to give its trial version a whirl before things get irrevocable.

   David presents his solution to two of the things that bug him about PDFs of academic papers: humungous borders and missing metadata (making them hard to find later by search).

   <a href="http://www.dagolden.com/index.php/2550/if-you-use-mongodb-and-perl-i-want-your-feedback/">If you use MongoDB and Perl, I want your feedback!</a><br>
   MongoDB is one of the only next-gen databases to support Perl in-house. By providing feedback on how you use MongoDB you will help demonstrate the value this work provides. (I have filled the survey; ++ -ed the module; filed several JIRA tickets; Blogged about using MongoDB with Perl. The first two only take 1-2 minutes. The rest will need more involvement.  ~szabgab)

   A new release of MongoDB is coming up. And a new trial version of its  driver is already accessible on CPAN. MongoDB peeps you know what that means.

   The latest development release of the <a href="https://metacpan.org/release/MongoDB" class="distribution">MongoDB</a> distribution includes a new interface to MongoDB's filesystem abstraction. David shows how you can use it.

   Most people see Perl 5 and 6 as siblings. David goes further, and see them as Cain and Abel. Who happen to be Highlanders. Stuck in an infernal device created by the Jigsaw killer.

   It is very frustrating when you submit a pull-request and noone responds to it for a year. It is also very embarrassing when you realize you were the one who did not respond to a pull-request. Now, with the help of a little Perl script written by David you can see the whole list of repos where there are pull-requests waiting for your attention.

   The trial version of the upcoming Path::Tiny release is available. If you are using Path::Tiny, you should give it a whirl, as there are incompatible changes coming down the pipe. And if you are not using Path::Tiny. You should. 'cause it's awesome.

   Perhaps you are the type of conservative soul who prefers consistency over sheer performance? Rejoice, for MongoDB has a new knob to adjust its behavior in that regard.
