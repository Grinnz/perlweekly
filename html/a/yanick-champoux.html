   Yanick updated his semantic version plugin for Dist::Zilla to accommodate all and any of the common versioning schemes CPAN modules use.

   <a href="http://techblog.babyl.ca/entry/fun-with-pod">Fun in POD-land</a><br>
   Yanick goes to town about his new craziness, <a href="https://github.com/yanick/Pod-Knit">Pod::Knit</a>, which you can get from github for now. It involves pod, XML, sausages, knitting and dancing kittens. I made one of those up.
</li>

<li>
   2014.12.23 in <a href="/archive/179.html">#179</a>
   <a href="http://techblog.babyl.ca/entry/merry-xmas">Working with Jolly Santa's Outstanding Notes</a><br>
   This is an Advent Calendar overflow about handling the favorite web-scale data structure during the XMas Holidays and after them. The think is, that tools like this and articles like this should reach people outside the Perl echo chamber.

   2015.01.07 in <a href="/archive/181.html">#181</a>
   <a href="http://techblog.babyl.ca/entry/oculi">The Hills Have Multi-Faceted Eyes</a><br>

   Yanick presents <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/File::Serialize">File::Serialize</a> which will (de)serialise YAML, JSON and TOML, using the 'right' module behind the scenes, so you don't have to remember which is the right module to use these days.
</li>

   2015.02.18 in <a href="/archive/187.html">#187</a>
   <a href="https://www.iinteractive.com/notebook/2015/02/18/bread-board.html">A Gentle Introduction to Bread::Board</a><br>
   Yanick introduces the <em>inversion of control</em> concept, and presents how you can do it with <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Bread::Board">Bread::Board</a>. Obviously Canada has multiple definitions for the word 'gentle'.
</li>

<li>
   2015.03.02 in <a href="/archive/188.html">#188</a>
   <a href="http://techblog.babyl.ca/entry/got-lib">got lib? Lieber Gott!</a><br>

   <a href="http://techblog.babyl.ca/entry/dancer-jasmine">Dancer + Jasmine</a><br>
   Absolutely awesome! Yanick had to test his Angular.js based code. So what did he do? He wrote a plugin for Perl Dancer. Jasmine is a behavior-driven development framework for testing JavaScript code. The new Dancer::Plugin::Test::Jasmine allows you to integrate the tests written in Jasmin with the test you write for your Perl-based back-end.

   Yanick continues his series on <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Bread::Board">Bread::Board</a>, showing how you can "manually create services and set them in a hierarchy of containers so that their inter-dependencies can be resolved by the system".

   <a href="http://techblog.babyl.ca/entry/making-docsets">Making Docsets</a><br>

   There are some weeks when I really suspect that Yanick has been snorting the orchid pollen. You'll have to decide for yourself if this is one of those weeks. (It's ok, Yanick's a friend, and a co-editor, so I have special dispensation to say things like this about him).
</li>

<li>
   2015.09.18 in <a href="/archive/217.html">#217</a>
   <a href="http://techblog.babyl.ca/entry/showterm">That will Showterm</a><br>
   Yanick demos a nifty service, <a href="https://showterm.io">showterm.io</a>, which will generate a javascript-powered animation of a terminal session. Handy if you want to include a pseudo interactive session showing how to use some command-line tool.

   Remember that scene in <em>The Empire Strikes Back</em>, where Leia says "I love you" to Han, and he coolly says "I know"? I thought of Yanick as Han Solo after I read this.
