   Daisuke Maki (lestrrat) writes that he is going to organize the biggest ever YAPC::Asia, which as you might know is not specifically a Perl event. It will also be the last one of its type. Unless of course someone steps up to organize more. It will take place on 20-22 August, 2015 in Tokyo.

   Maki-san's recap and reflections on the last YAPC::Asia Tokyo that he'll organise. I don't want to steal his thunder, but there were a lot of people there. You can also see <a href="http://30d.jp/yapcasia/8">some photos</a>, watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/yapcasia/videos">videos of the talks</a>, and read <a href="http://yapcasia.org/2015/news/08/yapcasia-tokyo-2015-blog-entries.html">blogs</a> (note that most of them are in Japanese).

   lestrrat could relax now. His 2000+ person conference in Japan is behind him. He told us about the secret behind it. He also gave one of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRy2cQmWKts">best lightning talks at YAPC::EU</a>.
