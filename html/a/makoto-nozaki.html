   Two weeks ago we linked to the proposal for the Ado web framework. It wasn't funded, primarily because there's already a lot of choice in Perl web frameworks, so it wasn't clear this was the best use of the funds ($4500 was requested).

   Nozaki-san has proposed a change to TPF rules for grants, aimed at defining a deadline for all grant applications, beyond which projects would be deemed to have failed. If you have an opinion, please add a comment.

   Nozaki-san wonders whether there should be a (monetary) award for "best Perl application" each year, to try and make a bit more noise about successful Perl apps. He wants to hear what we think, so why not let him know?
