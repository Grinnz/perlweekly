   <a href="http://blog.nu42.com/2014/10/why-was-documentation-for-single.html">Why was documentation for open FILEHANDLE removed from perlfunc?</a><br>

   In Perl-land, it's easy to lull oneself in the fallacy that all the world is UNIXish and do things like assuming that file path separators are always '/'s. Don't, Sinan begs of you, mostly considering that doing The Right Thing is not as hard as you might think.

   I totally agree with Sinan, especially when we are talking about such central module as Module::Install. The question, how can one easily notice and correct if one of the tests fails due the line ending differences between Windows and Unix and is there an article with 'best practices' for such situation?

   Sinan Unur keeps bumping into test failures while using perl 5.20.1 compiled with Visual Studio 2013 CE. I wonder if he is also sending bug-reports or even patches to fix these issues, or is he trying to get people understand the problems and fix them by themselves? Have you sent any patches (or pull requests) recently?
