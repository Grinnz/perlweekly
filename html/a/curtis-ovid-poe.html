   Annoyed that you have to punt 'with' statements at the very bottom of class declarations? Read on, as Ovid has a workaround for that.

   <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/ovid/2014/12/using-role-as-partial-classes.html">Using Roles as Partial Classes</a><br>
   Curtis Poe describes how roles can be treated as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(computer_programming)#Partial">partial classes</a>, a concept in some languages, where a class can be split into multiple files. A bit like roles, you might be thinking.

   <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/ovid/2014/12/a-small-puzzle-for-you.html">Pretty-printing multiple arrays</a><br>

   <a href="https://www.ziprecruiter.com">ZipRecruiter</a> is a job board startup based in California, and they're looking for Perl developers. A few people you might have heard of already work / contract there, and they allow remote work.

   Ovid needs you! He's crafting a Perl 6 presentation, and as a comparative exercise, he needs to have implementations of the classic Point class written in different languages.

   Curtis shows how Perl 6's gradual typing can prevent certain types of bugs in your code. He throws some other Perl 6 titbits in as well.

   The video from Curtis's talk at FOSDEM just over a month ago. Videos from <a href="http://video.fosdem.org/2015/devroom-perl/">some of the Perl talks</a> are available, but not all of them have complete audio, alas.

   Wouldn't it be nice if we could just take a chunk of arbitrary SQL and get a resultset from it? - Ovid asks and responds to himself with the release of DBIx::Class::Report. But when would you need it?

   Sqitch is a is tool (written in Perl) to manage changes in databases. Of course it is not perfect, but some of its flaws can be avoided, or at least detected by a simple test script Ovid shares with us.

   Following Dave's YAPC::EU lightning talk, Ovid shares some real-life code he saw in the wild. Warning: the code you're about to see may makes you groan, sigh, or heartfully head-desk.

   <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D2vDtkBRAg">Turning points</a><br>
   Ovid talks about past turning points in the history of Perl, and the one approaching, when Perl 6 is released. He argues that we should see this as an opportunity to promote both Perl 5 and Perl 6, and the community. For example, <a href="http://perl.com">perl.com</a> could really do with a facelift before the big day. Duration: 55 minutes

   <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/ovid/2015/09/fluent-interfaces-in-perl-6.html">Fluent interfaces in Perl 6</a><br>
   This started as a short post about Ovid adding a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluent_interface#Perl_6">Perl 6 example</a> to the wikipedia page on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluent_interface">fluent interfaces</a>. But it became a discussion (in the comments) on what fluent interfaces are all about.

   <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/ovid/2015/09/improved-dbixclass-usage-with-arbitrary-sql.html">Improved DBIx::Class usage with arbitrary SQL</a><br>
   Ovid's <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/DBIx::Class::Report">DBIx::Class::Report</a> module makes it easy to run ad-hoc SQL queries in your <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/DBIx::Class">DBIx::Class</a> code, and now he's added the capability to define additional methods on each result.

   <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/ovid/2015/10/divas-need-not-apply.html">Divas Need Not Apply</a><br>
   A rant by Ovid on how some Perl programmers cannot communicate properly. Not even when it is about finding a new job. Though it is unclear if he refers to some of the people in the active Perl community or other people who 'just' use Perl.

   If you do enough testing then you won't need much debugging, but if you do, you might want to see that in color.

   Curtis keeps beating on his "battle-tested" drum, that he introduced at least year's YAPC::EU. Perl may not be hip, but it's doing just fine, thankyouverymuch.
