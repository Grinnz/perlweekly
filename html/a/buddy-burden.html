   You've no doubt all seen that quotation, about the three hard things in computer science: naming, cache invalidation, and date/time processing? Buddy lists everything he wants from a module for processing dates, and then rates the leading CPAN modules against his requirements. He finds them all lacking in one way another, and tells us that his next blog post will be his thoughts on how we can improve things. This feels like the start of a horror movie: "don't open that door Buddy!"
