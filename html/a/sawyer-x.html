   In addition to all his advent posts, Sawyer announced a new release of Dancer 2. I'm starting to suspect that Sawyer is the name of a collective in Amsterdam.

   Sawyer's thoughts on the state of the Perl 5 community, after taking over from Matt. He ruminates on the definition of community and what sub-communities make up "the Perl 5 community". He ends with his proposed definition for what "community" is really about, and asks us all to think about how to grow our community. One line really resonated with me: "I know that perl fits in my head, and that's why I use it". Duration: 44 minutes.
