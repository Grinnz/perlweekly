   <a href="http://perlhacks.com/2014/12/dev-assistant">Dev Assistant</a><br>
   Dave came across 'Dev Assistant', a tool that aims at helping  neophyte developers into the many steps standing between the initial itch to the publication of a project. They support Perl, which is awesome, but they might need help to bring their Perl support up to Modern Perl  standards. So... who feels like assisting the assistant?

   Dave Cross got fed up by people wanting to solve problems using CGI while there are more modern solutions so he gave a lightning and announced he is going to write a new book covering modern Perl development. It's a funny coincidence that I've just posted an article listing the CGI-related Perl Maven articles.

   <a href="http://perlhacks.com/2015/07/culling-my-modules/">Culling My Modules</a><br>
   Dave built a nice dashboard showing the results of Travis-CI and Coveralls for all of his CPAN modules. That's great. Unfortunately that highlighted the fact that he has many modules that he has not interest maintaining and he is going to delete from CPAN. Or maybe its a good thing to make CPAN slimmer, but with a higher percentage of useful and maintained modules.

   Dave built a web app using <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Dancer2">Dancer2</a> and <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/DBIx::Class">DBIx::Class</a>, but found that it was running an awful lot of queries. He shares the secret of <em>prefetch</em>, which took one page from 120 queries down to 3.

   Apparently Red Hat beat P5P in breaking backward compatibility of the perl distribution. Red Hat has removed CGI.pm from their 'standard distribution of perl' 5 years ago with the release of RHEL 6.

   You don't need to port CGI programs to Dancer, Mojolicious, or Catalyst just in order to start using PSGI. You can easily switch to PSGI, get the advantages it provides and keep using your existing CGI code.
