   Why do the most commonly reused modules have the highest number of CPANTS failures? Is it their age? Is that the age of their authors? Maybe lack of willingness to change? Is there a specific metric that is a common source of failure or a specific author?

   It seems Neil does not have enough fun editing the Perl Weekly once every 3 weeks or so. Nor does he have enough on his plate running the <a href="http://neilb.org/2015/12/30/cpan-prc-2016.html">CPAN Pull Request Challenge</a> for a second time, and being in the <a href="http://neilb.org/2015/04/20/river-of-cpan.html">river cleaning business</a> up to his neck. Now he also wants to run his own weekly newsletter called <a href="http://cpan-weekly.org/">CPAN Weekly</a> giving you one CPAN module every week. I can only guess that he is looking for more ways to procrastinate... Good luck!

   This was my response to Rik's post. I think that rather than show just one person, we should show everyone who's done a release, in the order of whose released most recently.
