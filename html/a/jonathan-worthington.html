   Jonathan covers what he did in the first week of May (he's catching up after <a href="http://act.osdc.no/osdc2015no/">OSDC.no</a>): reducing the memory used by hashes, improving Rakudo's startup time on MoarVM, and fixing various bugs.

   Jonathan's write-up of work done in late June and early July: adding support for multi-dimensional arrays in MoarVM, changes to the regex engine, and a bunch of bug fixes.

   Jonathan had a productive week: getting multi-dimensional arrays working in the JVM (following MoarVM, which was done previously); thinking through the design for <code>await</code> to not take up a thread when waiting for the promise to complete; thinking about a friendly <a href="https://gist.github.com/jnthn/a56fd4a22e7c43080078">syntax for supplies</a>; some useful MoarVM bytecode instrumentation; fixed some regexp issues; and improved some error messages. In short: "Stuff Got Done".

   This week it's baby steps for Jonathan, as his time for Perl 6 was scant. But baby steps are steps still -- he still managed to do some work on multi-dimensional arrays, improve some error messages, and also removed a road-block for the next release.

   60 out of 100 issues that are needed for the Christmas release were fixed. NFG improvements is just one subject. Normal Form Grapheme is an efficient way of providing strings at grapheme level. Apparently there is an example when Unicode standard and 'how people think' differs.
