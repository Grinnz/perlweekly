   Olaf Alders provided his weekly report that was full of new items. You can now +1 Perl modules, use the public API of MetaCPAN and compete with other CPAN authors for fame.

   The idea behind this project is to encourage you to contribute to an open source project every day. Even if each contribution is small, this can get you in the practice of contributing.

   The CPAN web portals, search.cpan.org and metacpan, are incredibly important for our day-to-day work, and it's easy to forget that their continued existence is usually fueled by the unrelentless dedication of a few  volunteers and a budget that would make shoe strings seem opulent. In that optic, a new sponsor is always reason to celebrate. Huzzah for Panopta!

   The QA Hackathon is an excellent event and dispite its name it is not only about Quality Assurnce. It became a more generice event when some of the people maintaining the core infrastructure needed for the Perl world get together for some much needed face-to-face conversation. I had the luck participating in two of such events, and now I  had the privilage to even provide some funds to run the event. If you, or your company relies on Perl, this is a very good place to ensure the continous improvement of the whole ecosystem around Perl.

   "Sponsoring MetaCPAN makes perfect sense for <a href="https://www.bytemark.co.uk/">Bytemark</a>. It has the potential to save us weeks of developer time by helping our developers locate modules not included in the Perl standard distribution. Large Perl programs can use many modules, from those that interface with SQL databases to simple utilities."

   This is a state of the <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/HTTP::BrowserDetect">HTTP::BrowserDetect</a> nation from Olaf, who has been maintaining it for 5 years. He wants to let us know it's still very much actively maintained, and that he's keen to receive, and quick to act on, pull requests to keep the coverage update. And he also wants to shame those of us who are tardy at merging PRs, and rightly so.

   Localisation is hard, and finicky, and maddening. Which is why it's better to leave it to a module specifically to take that pain of shoulders. Numbers, percentages, monetary amounts, CLDR::Number knows how to format them all. McCarthy would approve.

   Olaf continues his series of updates about modules that he's adopted. He's done a developer release of <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Business::PayPal::API">Business::PayPal::API</a> - if you've any code that uses it, please take it for a spin.

   There is nothing more treacherous than a false assumption regarding what a library considers to be success, or "all is good", or "a raging bonfire of blistering victory".
