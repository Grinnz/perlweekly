<title>#48 - French workshop in 4 days and fund-raising for a Dancer project</title>
<link>http://perlweekly.com/archive/48.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi,&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;After a long time, I finally wrote a new blog entry on my site. It is still only a meta-article about writing articles, but I think I am on the right track. Be prepared for more articles from me!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;This issue is still full of links to YAPC::NA related articles. People are still writing their reports. The more the better! Other people take notice if there are many articles. If you have not written yours yet, go ahead and do so! The official videos have also started to appear on YouTube. I have already watched three.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Other than that, I think I&#x27;ll just let you read the articles:&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>Promoting Perl to Dissimilar Users</title>
<link>http://www.modernperlbooks.com/mt/2012/06/promoting-perl-to-dissimilar-users.html</link>
<description>YAPC::NA was opened by the keynote of Michael Schwern talking about the lack of diversity in the Perl community. Especially among those who attend Perl workshops and conferences. chromatic is taking the point to the technical direction, and suggests we should make Perl easier for those who don&#x27;t look like us.</description>

<title>Marpa &#x26; customizing the Ruby Slippers</title>
<link>http://blogs.perl.org/users/jeffrey_kegler/2012/06/marpa-customizing-the-ruby-slippers.html</link>
<description>Jeffrey Kegler has released Marpa::R2, and I am wondering when D2 will be added. Anyway, what I really like is the &#x27;situational awareness&#x27; that helps providing better error messages for when the parsing fails. That&#x27;s actually one of the major issues I see with regexes: how do you know why it has not matched. This might be a better solution.</description>

<title>Sqitch: Rename Step Objects and the SQL Directory?</title>
<link>http://justatheory.com/computers/databases/sqitch-steps-to-change.html</link>
<description>One of the easiest refactoring steps is renaming a variable or a subroutine. They are technically easy but mentally? How can you come up with a name that better describes some entity or some process in your application? That&#x27;s the underlying problem David E. Wheeler faces this week.</description>

<title>One of my most used and least understood perl snippets </title>
<link>http://lylemelick.blogspot.co.il/2012/06/one-of-my-most-used-and-least.html</link>
<description>Manfred B. Perl shows a snippet to remove leading and trailing white spaces that generated 12 comments! Last time I saw a question about this there were  - I think - over 50 comment on LinkedIN. I think perl needs to have a trim function to eliminate all these repeated bike sheddings. (Actually the code in this blog is similar to what I show in class to point out why I prefer to use 2 simple regexes instead of one complex, and incorrect one.)</description>

<description>Joel Berger has spent most of his time preparing his talks at YAPC::NA but apparently Alien::Base is already in a pre-alpha status. It has not seen a 0.001 release, but you could already start playing with it. On both Linux and Windows. Mac still has some issues.</description>

<description>Jonathan Houge from Columbus.pm is trying to implement an idea of pastor Sandy Brown to make it easier to help people in need. Regardless of our religious affiliation (or not) this sounds like a nice idea. They are trying to rais some funds, so they can work on the project. Besides the fact that this is nice idea, Jon has also told me he is planning to use Dancer for this project and teach the other two developers - who are Ruby developers - to use Dancer. It is up to your consideration if you&#x27;d like to help them get funded. I put down some money.</description>

<description>scrottie is not a regular Perl blogger, so it was especially nice to see his writing about YAPC. I only wish he added a few more links to YAPC, some talks, and the people he mentioned. That makes it easier for the readers to further research, and makes search engines happier.</description>

<description>Andy Lester (petdance) has also described his experience on the Perl Buzz web site. He gave a very nice lightning talk about Ack 2, and then uploaded the first alpha version of it. In this post, Andy describes the talks he attended in great detail. Very useful for people who could not attend them or who could, but need a reminder.</description>
