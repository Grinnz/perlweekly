     "Last week I included a call to <a href=\"https://www.gittip.com/yanick/\">support Yanick via GitTip</a> that resulted a few people giving him money, and we also talked about it. As <a href=\"https://www.gittip.com/pjf/\">PJF</a> told me, one can set up a team-account in GitTip so people can give tips to a project and then the members of the project can divide the money. So I set up a <a href=\"https://www.gittip.com/PerlWeekly/\">GitTip account for the Perl Weekly</a> and it already received some gifts. We don't expect to be super-rich from this (at least not in the next few weeks ;), but it would be awesome to get presents from hundreds, or even thousands of our readers. Just 1 cent! Think about it!",
     "The other idea that was suggested by Yanick was to include a new section called 'GitTip Profile of the week'. I find this a good idea as it will give us an opportunity to introduce an open source Perl contributor a week without running lengthy interviews :). It will also give you an opportunity to give a small weekly present to these people. I am going to look at the people listed in the <a href=\"https://www.gittip.com/for/perl/\">Perl community on GitTip</a>, and the mashup created by Neil Bowers called <a href=\"http://neilb.org/cpan-tip/\">CPAN Tip</a>.",
