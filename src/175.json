     "Advant is here! While you might not celebrate the Chrisitan Advent, it became a tradition in the Perl community as well to create advent calendars. Which means 24 articles in 24 days. We won't be able to cover all articles published in the Advent calendars, but you can see a list of them in  the Advent section, and you can follow the one maintained by Len Jaffe who jas been collecting the various Advent calendars for years. Which brings me to another point. All of these calendars are written by volunteer contributors. Not necessarily core developers. You could also contribute an article!",
