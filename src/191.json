      "Hi,",
      "There are two Hackathons going to take place in close proximity in time, but quite far away. One in Berlin and the other one in New York. The former is the traditional annual QA Hackathon with a number of people flying in from various other places of the globe, therefore they still need help with some funding. I am happy to tell you that thanks to the growing number of advertisers in the Perl Weekly, and thanks to the people who contribute to the Perl Weekly via <a href=\"https://gratipay.com/PerlWeekly/\">Gratipay</a> I could use some of that money to sponsor the QA Hackathon! (The still <a href=\"http://blogs.perl.org/users/olaf_alders/2015/03/the-perl-qa-hackathon-is-still-looking-for-sponsors.html\">need some more</a>.)",
