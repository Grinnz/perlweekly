# Say It With Flowers
2014-02-16

Authoring modules on CPAN is very often an act of love, and from all times the
community explored ways to say 'thank you' to the persons who make the Perl
ecosystem what it is. Recently, the site Gittip caught a few eyes, and now
sees a budding Perl community. Some of the links of this week discuss
how to join the party, and why it might a good thing.  Beyond this, we have
news of a new Mojolicious-centered conference happening in May, a preview of
what's coming in Perl 5.20, and a nice collection of tutorials. Enjoy!
