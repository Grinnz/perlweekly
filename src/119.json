     "Hi,",
     "Last week I had this little experience with various interesting Unicode characters in the Perl Weekly. On the web site it worked out well, but in the e-mail there were a few glitches. Most likely due to Mailman that I still use to handle the newsletter. (And it is a rather old version of Mailman, so I can't really blame it.) The subject line was missing the [Perlweekly] tag that Mailman should have included (and I hope it does this time again) and several people mentioned that they have not seen the â™¥ in the subject line. I think the body of the message went through just fine."
