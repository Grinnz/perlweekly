      "And of course the big news that was announced last week, that RJBS, the Pumpking has resigned still echoes. Both in posts where people are thanking his work and announcement of the new Pumpking.",
      "There were two new events announced too. Both in September in Austria. I wonder if one could go to the first one and than cycle over to the second one which is about 500 km away.",
