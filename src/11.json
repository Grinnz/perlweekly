I would like to see more and better documentation, but this rant was totally useless. If you find a module lacking documentation and you are already reading the source code to understand how to use it, please, spend an hour or two writing some PODs and sending to the author. Or just publish them as a blog entry. This will make our whole ecosystem better.",
