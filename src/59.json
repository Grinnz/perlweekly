I don't know if those people are better or worse Perl programmers than the ones who contribute. One thing is clear. It is harder to evaluate them. Assuming the evaluation is mostlty about 'generated code' and not, for example 'ability to cooperate' or 'ability to follow instructions'. Certainly a subject worth exploring.",
