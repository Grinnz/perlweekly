       "Great news! I have released my first mobile application. Well, this is still only a skeleton. There are only 4 pages, but it is very promising. :) By the time you read this, I might be able to release a new version, which is slightly better. OK I admit. If you install it in the next 24 hours, I have chance of winning a Nexus 7. See 'Regex Maven for Android' below."
