      " This week, Neil -- the mastermind behind the CPAN PR Challenge -- draws our attention on another, new contest organized by Digital Ocean, where one can win a t-shirt by submitting at least 4 pull requests to Open Source projects. He even went above and beyond the call of duty, and provided an addendum to the official and shamefully Perl-devoid list of example projects for the contest. At the other end of the spectrum, Ribashushi is trying something novel: he's organizing a Tilt campaign that would enable him to work on CPAN projects for a full year -- beyond the obvious, it's also quite an interesting idea in the realm of Open Source founding, and I am rather curious to see how it'll develop. Enjoy! ~ `/anick "
