This time I've removed the links to Twitter, Facebook and Google+ as I have not seen a lot of people using them. We'll see if this fixes the problem.",
     "In any case, I'd like to make sure the articles in the Perl Weekly get a wide-spread coverage. So when you read an article, please invest the extra 10 seconds to Tweet about it or post it on Google+. If you added 'seen on the +Perl Weekly' or 'via @perlweekly' that would be extra awesome, but even just by further distributing the articles you do a lot for the Perl community.",

It can be fun to just show up at the conference and go with the flow, but it might be a lot better to plan ahead. Not only picking the talks you'd like to hear but trying to figure out what other social events would you like to attend and who you would like to talk to. You can even send e-mail or contact using other means people you would like to meet.",
