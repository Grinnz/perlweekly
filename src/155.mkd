# There Be Cobwebs In Those Coffers
2014-07-14

This week, we have echos of the next conferences coming out way (YAPC::EU, the
Perl Swiss Workshop, the next London.pm meetings). We also have some updates
of the financial state of some of Perl's fundations and, alas without
surprises, it seems we are running on a very lean budget -- perhaps a reminder
to us all to poke our $workplaces and see if they can't help in some way to
keep the ecosystem alive and well-fed. ~ `/anick
