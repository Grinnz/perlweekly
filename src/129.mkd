# PAUSE Stopped, Now Plays Again
January 13th, 2014

The big excitement of the week undubitably has been
the Perl NOC suffering the failure of several hard 
drives, which resulted in the PAUSE server going down
and brought
the upload of new modules to a dead stop.
Thanks to the brave souls behind those services, everything is 
already back in business, and the stream of new modules
and releases is flowing once more. 
NOC heroes who made this speedy recovery possible,
we salute you. ~ `/anick

The future needs you. IO:Socket::IP is planned to be added to Perl 5.20,

2014-01-05

Just like English, Perl borrows liberally from other languages, is full of
what seems to be redundance, and have quite its fair share of quirks. 
Coincidence? No, not really. Buddy Burden dives deep into Perl's linguistic heritage.

### Why I Didn't Submit A Patch
http://blogs.perl.org/users/ovid/2014/01/why-i-didnt-submit-a-patch.html
2014-01-08

It's a harsh reality, but it stands to reason: for your project to get 
contributions, you have to reduce the hoops the wannabe contributors has to
jump through  to as close as zero as possible. That can mean, amongst other
things and for better or worse, having your project using the VCS and/or
hosting site that is the de facto standard in your community. Ovid explains
how, in his case, that made the difference between investing time into pushing
a patch, or not.


## Testing

2014-01-12

Git::Repository is one of the many Perl interfaces to Git. At the core,
it is meant to be simple and minimalist. Recently, it began to offer
additional features via the use of plugins. This latest addition to the herd 
should be most pleasing to any DWIM partisan.

2014-01-05

So you have this Perl program that you want to use as a standalone
application. No libraries to install, just a vanilla perl on the target
machine, your file, and that's it. David Farrell shows you how that's possible
to do using App::FatPacker.

2014-01-10

DateTime isn't the only kid on the block when it comes to temporal needs.
There is also the friendlier Time::Piece which, David Farrell argues, might
fit most of your needs.

2014-01-10

Some epic projects also bring fortuitous collateral goodies.
The space race gave us disposable diapers, Moonpig, a more rational 
interface to the powerful DateTime module. Mark J Dominus makes the 
case for it.

damage. Here, Jeffrey Thalhammer shows us how to tweak Pinto to use

normal.
