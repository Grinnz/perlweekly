I stayed with his family before the conferenc and came back for a few more days. I enjoy being with them very much and I don't know how many years will pass till I can see them again!",
	 "There are not many items this week as many of the regular authors were busy at YAPC::NA but reports about the confrence started to appear, so I link to some of them",
	 "YAPC::EU is getting closer. The dead-line to submit talk proposals is 15th July. Right after YAPC::EU you can also participate at the Moose Hackathon organized by the Oslo Perl Mongers. The dead-line to sign up to the hackathon is 25th June! Just a week from now. It looks awesome (as all the other events the Oslo.PM organizes). Check it out!",
