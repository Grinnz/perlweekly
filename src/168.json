      " This week we have something that is bound to make our Windows-using brethren happy: berrybrew, a perlbrew/plenv equivalent for Strawberry Perl, by David Farrell. We also have a few nice grant reports. And, in the everlasting fun department, Sinan's playing with quines lead to dark archaeological discoveries about 'open' and 'autodie'. Enjoy!  Oh, and if you are based in Canada, happy Thanksgiving! ~ `/anick "
