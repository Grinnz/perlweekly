      "The main tech news of the week has to be the Shellshock exploit. Does it affect Perl? Fortunately, not that much (David Farrell has the details). In other news, a new version of DBD::SQLite will soon be released, a new Perl book is in the making, and Perl will be participating in the next iteration of the OPW -- all providing us with  delightful reasons for looking forward to the months ahead. Enjoy!  ~ `/anick"
