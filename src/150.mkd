# Out With the Old. In With the New
January 6th, 2014

Welcome everyone to this brand-sparkling new year! This week,
a lot of looks back to 2013, but also a pleasing heap of new stuff -- releases,
initiatives, projects, programming patterns. If its first week is any
indication, 2014 is going to be a good year. A very good year indeed. ~ `/anick
