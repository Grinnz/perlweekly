	  "I enjoyed myself very much walking around in Kiev and the conference was also great. On the first day there were several talks in English. The second day I spent in the hallway track. vti has already wrote about it (see below), but I hope we'll see several other reports written about the event.",
      "It seems giving names is a central theme of this issue. There are at least 3 items related to the importance and the difficulty of naming things.",
      "Lastly, let me point out, that Damian Conway will give a talk in New York, in May 17. See details below.",
