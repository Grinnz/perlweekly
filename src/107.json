Christian Walde) has a long fight improving the position of Perl. The simple point is that it would be probably hard to get TIOBE fixed and we - people writing about Perl - are misleading the way it creates its ranking. (You can see some numbers in the post and in the comment section.) So the suggestion is to use the expression 'Perl Programming' in places where you'd normally just write Perl. You might think 'why should we play according to their rules?', but isn't that what we do when we provide solutions in broken environments, using utdated software? Isn't that part of what we, Perl programmers, excell? Mithaldu included some simple instructions what you could do, even if you don't have a web site.",
