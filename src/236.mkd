# Grants, Testing and Fighting Entropy
2016-02-01

This week we have a few articles on testing web thingies (mocking web
services, using SWAT, that kind of fun stuff), encouraging grant reports 
(shiny things are happening while we aren't looking), an early case
of Spring cleaning fever (where entropy is fought and modules put to
adoption). Oh, yes, and a modest proposal is made for a new Perl operator.
Enjoy! ~ `/anick

Using mod_perl? If so, you might want to test the trial version of its 
upcoming update.

### 100+ Modules for Adoption! (Bit Rot Thursday)

Zoffix is going through an early Spring cleaning. He deleted a few of his old
distributions, and put a bunch (and I really mean a /bunch/) of other up for adoption.

That bloke, there, in the waders, taking water samples from the might CPAN
river? That's our Neil.

Entropy waits for no-one. Every distribution released on CPAN, if left to itself,
will slowly mush away. So what one should do? Fight the inexorable advance of decay?
Give up? Embrace the chaos? Zoffix discusses those many paths.

### The Fuse Operator - A Suggested Language Extension

"I wish Perl had that one extra operator" is not something you hear very
often. The "fuse" operator would be something for safe, non-auto-vivificating,
deferencing. And, I must admit, it does sounds appealing.


## Testing


### Mock Testing Web Services with Mojo

So you want to test something interacting with a web service without, y'know,
doing terrible things to that web service... If we were talking about a class
or a function, you'd mock it in a heart-beat. Well, the same can be done for
web services, here via a Mojo-based impostor.


### curl + swat VS selenium

You'd be hard-pressed to find such two wildly different test automation tools. 
But how do they compare for the same task? Melezhik finds out.

### UTF-16 and Windows CRLF, oh my

Running Perl on Windows? Dealing with UTF-16? You want to read this. Unless
you're into learning things the hard way. In which case, don't read this. And
stock up on headache medicine.

v3 of the web service IronMQ is coming up, and  the maintainer of IO::Iron is
already on deck, making sure that when the time come, he'll have all his ducks in a row.

tasks with categories, thanks to this new plugin.

The migration of blogs.perl.org to the PerlBee platform is slowly making
progress. We can already peer at the work done in its GitHub repository,
and a wider audience test instance is supposed to become accessible
soonishingly.

Bolts tightened here, squeaky cogs oiled there. Lot of little improvements

article.
