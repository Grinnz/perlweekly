     "As Perl 6 is getting closer to an official release we see more and more negative comments. This is understandable. Most of us are afraid of change most of the time and when Perl 6 is released they will need to confront their long-held view that it will never happen. Some react with anger trying to put other people down. Some of these people will come around.",
     "This however should not be confused with legitimate concerns. Such as the one voiced by Kaare. This comes from love and appreciation to the hard work done by all the Perl 6 developer throughout the years.",
     "Let's enjoy the week in peace! Even among Perl developers.",
     "ps. There are now 5,892 subscribers to the Perl Weekly. I wonder if we will reach 6,000 before Perl 6 is released ?"
