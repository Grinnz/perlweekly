      " This week we have a few articles on testing web thingies (mocking web services, using SWAT, that kind of fun stuff), encouraging grant reports (shiny things are happening while we aren't looking), an early case of Spring cleaning fever (where entropy is fought and modules put to adoption). Oh, yes, and a modest proposal is made for a new Perl operator. Enjoy! ~ `/anick "
