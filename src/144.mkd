# Prime Time For Learning
2014-04-28

Lots of learning material in this edition. Amongst other things,
Dave Cross is making a pdf version of his "Data Munging with Perl" available,
and the German Perl Workshop talks are now on YouTube. Also, summer is coming,
and with it the different student coding programs that are now part of the
season -- and Perl has some very promising proposals in store for them.  ~ `/anick

Dave Cross offers a free pdf version of his book "Data Munging with Perl".
The book may be on the old side, but its chapters aged like wine; a few might have gone a
bit sour, but most of them are still pretty delectable.

Neil Bowers is a relentless machine. With a dedication not seen since the
T-800 went out of production, he obtains the
co-maintainership of CPAN modules to clean up their documentation, refresh
their code, and generally give them needed dust-off.

Mop can't have protected attribute variables! bemoans Yuki Kimoto. Actually,
it can, corrects Toby Inkster from the comment section.

http://blogs.perl.org/users/brian_d_foy/2013/04/cpan-spring-cleaning-time-again.html
2014-04-15

It's Spring! Which means it's cleaning season. So, as brian d foy proposes, 
why not take the
opportunity to remove some of the cruft accumulated in your PAUSE directory?

### Perl and Windows UAC

The Windows registry... an Escher-inspired bedlam if there was ever one.
Michael Roberts shares here a little module that is a blessing for anyone
cursed to wander this byzantine maze.


### Executing remote commands from a Dancer application

2014-04-22

Maybe not code you want to make available to the outside world, but something that
can sure be handy in a pinch.  Johandry Amador shows us how he uses Dancer as
a centralized service firing remote commands to a group of machines.

### Facebook Authentication in Perl with Mojolicious (Lite)
http://programming.tudorconstantin.com/2014/04/perl-facebook-authentication-mojolicious.html
2014-04-23

Authentication is one of those complex interaction things that are almost guaranteed to make our
heads swim. Fortunately, most web frameworks have helpful plugins to abstract
most of the headache away. Here, Tudor Constantin shows us how to deal with
Facebook authentication within Mojolicious.

### A non-exceptional failure in the catch block

Exceptions are tricky. Sinan Unur hits a classical wrong assumption  in his
code and share it, for our enlightenment and as a warning to us all.

Mark Jason Dominus reminisces about his brush with Oulipo,
a society of writers that takes delight in "constrained writing", which is not
totally unlike code golfing with natural languages.

### Testing Lies

2014-04-23

Testing is all about trusting nothing. Yet, some things are so deeply
ingrained that it's hard to recognize how implicitly they are taken for
granted. Fortunately, Ovid is there to turn us into better paranoids.
