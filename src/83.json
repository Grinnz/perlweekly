     "There is also a huge list of Perl events for the next few months. I included the four closest, (actually that's 5), but they are all less than 2 month from now. I wonder if we should have a section listing the upcoming Perl Monger events as well, or if I should collect those and put them in some format on the web site. If for nothing else to provide some link-value to these sites.",
