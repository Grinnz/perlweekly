      " This weekend was rocking Perl on both sides of the Atlantic. On the New World side: The Pittsburgh Perl Workshop. Meanwhile in the Old World: the London Perl Workshop. No doubt helped by a 6 hours headstart, echoes and reports already began to trickle about the latter event. Amongst other things: Mark Keating was awarded the Silver Camel (congrats!). Of the PPW nary a word yet, but you can bet that will change by next week. Till then, enjoy! `/anick"
