      " Summer is here, and with the nice sunny time, blog entries are getting a little more scarce. But we still have a few nice morsels for you this week. The Perl6 weekly is back in force, Reini found out an itsy bitsy little thing that, once tweaked, improved the speed of the Perl 5 core testing by a lot, and, uh, I might have full mad scientist while  nobody was looking. So, pour yourself a nice exotic drink, bring the tablet/phone/laptop outside, and enjoy both your PerlWeekly and some of the Sun's warmth! ~ `/anick"
