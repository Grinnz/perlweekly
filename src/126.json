     "Hi,",
     "it is just about Chrismas and while a large chunk of the world does not celebrate it, I am sure many of the readers of the Perl Weekly have a few days off around the holiday. (I have received vacation autoresponders last week already saying that they will be back in the office on Januar 7. Now that's a vacation!",
     "Anyway, this week we celebrated the 26th birthday of Perl, the While Camel award winners were announced.  There is a World wide Perl competiion run by the DFW Perl Mongers. I just found out about the Perl Oasis West, that just a month away in Tampa FL, and I saw the next Russian Perl confrence announced to be held in Kiev, Ukraine. (No, I don't want to get involved in the Europe-Ukraine-Russia political debate.)",
     "I was hoping people will slow down and go on vacation, but instead of that, tons of articles.",
     "Enjoy!"
