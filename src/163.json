IMHO it would be great to have a centralized place where people who actively work on perl core could list their TODO items, break them down into smaller steps, and let others, who might have time, to join in implementing specific steps needed to accomplis that TODO item. A roadmap of many individual roads. Maybe an enhanced (I am not sure in what way though) version of the current <a href=\"http://perl5.git.perl.org/perl.git/blob/HEAD:/Porting/todo.pod\">TODO list</a>. Maybe including the names of the people who consider each item as their personal goal with links to RT tickets and branches where the work already happens.",
