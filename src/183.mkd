# Glyphs and Badges
2015-01-25

We're already at our fourth edition for this year. January is almost over --
that sound you're hearing is the PR Challenge contestants hurrying to get
their patches ready  before February rolls in. In other news, we have some
visual candy for you this month: David Farrell
brings us some new nifty Perl-themed glyphs, and mdk crafted a badge for all
the CPAN testers out there. Enjoy!  ~ `/anick

CPAN Testers, integral to the success of Perl as an ecosystem, but 
seldom actively noticed. To let those unsung heroes taste
a little bit of the glamour, mdk proposes a series of smoking signs.

### CPAN Cleaning Day 2457044: Compiler::Lexer

Using the postfix deferences that came with Perl 5.20? If you do, you might
notice that Perl::MinimumVersion and Perl::MinimumVersion::Fast are a bit
sloppy and think your code is respectively vintage 5.004 or 5.008. This 
irks brian, so he rolled up his sleeves and dove into the C++-fueled heart of 
darkness.

Graham previously extolled the potential of FFI (Foreign Function Interface)

'Yertl' suspiciously ressemble the sound a strangled dba makes. It's also 
a new set of command-line tools to deal with database ETL operations that 
looks very promising.
