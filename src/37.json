      "I am really glad we get these reports about the QA Hackathon as this a very good way to inform the Perl community about what happened in Paris. It can also help showing the sponsors how their money was used and what progress was achieved. It will also be very helpful in raising money for the next event.",

I also like the fact that his work-place let him do this as an open source project. We need more companies like Iovation.",

I think this can be a much better use of the money TPF got than trying to have many small grants. I also think that Paul is a person who will be able to execute what he planned.
